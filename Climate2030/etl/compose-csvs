# columns; it just treats the whole CSV file as a normal text file.
# But for, e.g., fixing the YouTube links (see features.org for more),

Compose all of the MacArthur Foundation 2019 Proposal CSV files.

Usage:

  $ compose-csvs \\
       --proposals-csv=PROPOSALS_CSV \\
       --admin-review-csv=ADMIN_REVIEW_CSV \\
       --judge-evaluation-csv=JUDGE_EVALUATION_CSV \\

       --toc-dir=TOC_DIR \\
       --attachments-dir=ATTACHMENTS_DIR \\
       --tdc-config-dir=TDC_CONFIG_DIR

Command-line options:
  --proposals-csv FILE            FILE is a csv FILE representing the bulk
                                  of the proposal information

  --admin-review-csv FILE         FILE is a csv FILE representing which applications
                                  in PROPOSALS_CSV should be included

  --judge-evaluation-csv FILE     FILE is a csv FILE with a many to one relationshp
                                  between judges and the proposals they evaluated,
                                  with the extra data being their evaluation

  --pare N                        Reduce the nuber of tiems to 1/N rows, for quick
                                  testing and development

  --toc-dir DIR                   DIR is the directory where extra TOCs will be placed for loading
                                  up to the torque wiki with csv2wiki.  If not included, TOCs won't
                                  be generated.

  --attachments-dir DIR           DIR is a directory for compose-csvs to look in for what attachments
                                  will be uploaded to the torque wiki.  It needs to have subdirectories
                                  by proposal number.

  --tdc-config-dir DIR            DIR is the location for files that are the base configuration files
                                  needed by TorqueDataConnect, and can be optionally, manually, put on
                                  the torque wiki.  We don't autmoatically do that because we want to
                                  overwrite the configuration out there.
