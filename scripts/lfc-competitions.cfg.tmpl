# Regarding the next field:
# 
# Note that this competition has another column called
# "Identification Number of Principal Organization".
#
# I think its value is supposed to indicate the type
# or domain of the information in the field we're
# actually using?  But I'm not sure.  Some of the
# values fit with this theory, for example...
#
#   "India: FCRA Registration Number"
#   "Netherlands: KVK Number"
#   "United Kingdom: Charity Number"
#   "United Kingdom: Company Number"
#   "United States: Employer Identification Number (EIN)"
#
# ...etc.  But other values can be quite weird,
# and sometimes they even include the ID number.
#
# To see all those values, use this command if you have the raw
# spreadsheet available:
#
#   $ csv-scope 100Change2020/data/bigdata/Export-reg-and-app-data-Submission-deadline-06082019-fixed-by-OTS.csv | grep "Identification Number of Principal Organization:" | grep -v -E "Identification Number of Principal Organization: +NULL" | sort | uniq
