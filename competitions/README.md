# Competitions

These directories are competitions that we have deployed.

Each has an ansible and an etl directory.  The former contains the
playbook and support to install that competition, while the latter
can be run after the competition is deployed to install the data.

As noted in [../INSTALL.md](../INSTALL.md) and above, a lot of the files
necessary to understand and complete the data deployment are confidential,
and so reside on a private server.  The ansible scripts, however,
should be usable by anyone.
