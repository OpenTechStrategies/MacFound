A Demo site for the [2020 100&Change](../100Change2020/) competition.

This demonstrates how someone might skin a competition as a public facing
site.  Right now it depends heavily on some internal code that's stored in
svn (and asked about during the ansible install), and is relatively unusable
outside of having access to that.

However, if a public skin does become something we want to write, this is
a good starting point.

## Note for OTS Members

You need to have the torque-sites svn directory checked out, and to have
run the ansible install and etl pipeline for the
[2020 100&Change](../100Change2020/) competition first.
