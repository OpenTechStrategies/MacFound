Good morning!

Another competition is ramping up, and that means another Okta chiclet.  Here's the standard email:

The configuration for simplesaml is:

    Single Sign On URL: https://torque.leverforchange.org/simplesaml/module.php/saml/sp/saml2-acs.php/<COMPETITION_NAME>
    Audience Restriction URL: https://torque.leverforchange.org/simplesaml/module.php/saml/sp/metadata.php/<COMPETITION_NAME>
    Default Relay State URL: https://torque.leverforchange.org/<COMPETITION_NAME>/index.php/?saml_sso=<COMPETITION_NAME>

As normal, we'll need okta enabled for the Torque Admin group, as well as the LfC Staff group

The variables we'll need set up are:

    groups
    username
    email
    first name
    last name

I'll configure the metadata url on my side as soon as I have it, and then I'll send out another mail as soon as the competition is up and I've gotten access.

Thanks!
