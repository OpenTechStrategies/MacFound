This competition was the original 2017 100&Change competition.

If you go back far enough in this repository (sha
[c3dfc85](https://github.com/OpenTechStrategies/torque-sites/tree/c3dfc85)
or so), that's all this repository was.  But it was updated to work
with torque, and now lives here.

See [INSTALL.md](../INSTALL.md) for installation instructions.
