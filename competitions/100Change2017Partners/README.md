The Partners site for the [2017 100&Change](../100Change2017/) competition.

Originally, this was a duplicated wiki with a redacted set of data, however
now it uses the dataset from 100Change2017 via torque.  Therefore, the only
really ETL pipeline work is piggy backing on that ETL pipeline.

Therefore, when running the installation instructions for this site,
you have to first run the ansible install and ETL pipeline for that.
